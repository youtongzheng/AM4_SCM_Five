                               !    NIGLOBAL_ and NJGLOBAL_ are the number of thickness
                               !  grid points in the zonal and meridional
                               !  directions of the physical domain.
#define NK_ NONSENSE_NK
                               !    The number of layers.

#undef STATIC_MEMORY_
                               !    If STATIC_MEMORY_ is defined, the principle
                               !  variables will have sizes that are statically
                               !  determined at compile time.  Otherwise the
                               !  sizes are not determined until run time. The
                               !  STATIC option is substantially faster, but
                               !  does not allow the PE count to be changed at
                               !  run time.
#undef  SYMMETRIC_MEMORY_
                               !    If defined, the velocity point data domain
                               !  includes every face of the thickness points.
                               !  In other words, some arrays are larger than
                               !  others, depending on where they are on the 
                               !  staggered grid.

#define NIPROC_ NONSENSE_NIPROC
                               !    NIPROC_ is the number of processors in the

                               !    NJPROC_ is the number of processors in the

                               !  arrays, so it should be set generously.
